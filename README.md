## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a **single-page landing website** designed for a coffee café.  
Before development, I conducted **design research** by analyzing popular café and food-brand landing pages to understand:

- Layout structure
- Typography hierarchy
- Color palettes
- Call-to-action placement
- Responsive behavior across devices

Based on this research, I translated the design ideas into a functional and visually appealing landing page using **React.js**.
